# Chapter №2
### Exercise №1
`source file ex1.cpp`
Task:
Write a program to calculate the cost of a round trip to the house.
The input data is:
- distance to house (km);
- volume of gasoline a car consumes per 100 km;
- the price of one liter of gasoline.
#### Example of program execution result:
`Enter the value for calculation`
`Distance to house (km): 67`
`Fuel consuption (liters per 100 km): 8.5`
`Price per liter of gasoline: `
`A trip to the house and back will cost: 569.5`
### Exercise №2
`source file ex2.cpp`
Task:
Write a program to calculate the purchase price with a discount applied. A 3% discount is applied if the purchase amount is greater than 500 rubles, and a 5% discount is applied if the purchase amount is greater than 1,000 rubles.
#### Example of program execution result:
`Enter purchase amount: 640`
`You are given a 3 % discount.`
`Amount including discount: 620.80`
### Exercise №3
`source file ex3.cpp`
Task:
Write a program that implements the "Guess the Number" game. The computer thinks of a number between 0 and 999 (use random number generation), and the user guesses it. At each step, the guesser makes a guess, and the user reports how many digits of the number were guessed and how many of the guessed digits occupy the correct positions in the number. For example, if the number 725 is thought of and it is assumed that the number 523 is thought of, then two digits (5 and 2) have been guessed, and one of them is in the correct position.
#### Example of program execution result:
`######################################################`
`#    The computer generated a three-digit number.    #`
`#    You must guess it. After entering each number,  #`
`#    you will be told how many numbers are guessed   #`
`#    and how many of them are in their places.       #`
`######################################################`
`Your variant: 123`
`Guessed: 0. In their places: 0`
`Your variant: 456`
`Guessed: 1. In their places: 0`
`Your variant: 654`
`Guessed: 2. In their places: 2`
`Your variant: 657`
`Guessed: 2. In their places: 2`
`Your variant: 658`
`Guessed: 3. In their places: 3`
`***You guessed the number 658!***`
