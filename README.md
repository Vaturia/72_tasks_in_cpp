# Description
In this repository, I offer solutions to problems from the book "Bonus to the C++ Self-Study Guide.".
The repository contains folders of the form `ch№`. Each folder contains a `README` file describing each problem and a 3rd .cpp file with the solution to each problem.
The solutions were tested on Linux, perhaps in the future I will make the solutions cross-platform and test them on the Windows operating system.
Currently, solutions for 18 problems out of 72 are presented.
