# Chapter №6
### Exercise №1
Task:
Write a program that displays a working "electronic clock" on the screen,
which runs until the user presses any key.
#### Example of program execution result:
```
=============================================
=                                           =
=              Cool Clock!                  =
=                                           =
=============================================
               __      __  __
             ||__| ..  __||  |
             | __| `` |__ |__|


For exit, enter any button...
```
### Exercise №2
Task:
Write a program that checks whether the user's input is an integer.
#### Example of program execution result:
```
Enter string: 36.7
36.7 isn`t even number
```
### Exercise №3
Task:
Write a program to track student grades. To do this, create a text file named input_data.txt containing a list of 10 students and their grades in three subjects: mathematics, physics, and computer science.
File Contents:
* the first line contains the total number of students;
* each subsequent line contains the student's full name and three integers (grades);
* The data in the row is separated by spaces, and the ratings range from 1 to 5.

Then create a class that will read data from the file.
Display the students' full names and grades in descending order of their average score.
#### Example of program execution result:
```
